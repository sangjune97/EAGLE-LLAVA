Both jars have the same number of balls, and the balls in the first jar are larger than those in the second jar.\n\nTo compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample, we need to know the mass of each jar and the average speed of the particles. The mass of the first jar is 380 u, and the mass of the second jar is 380 u. The average speed of the particles in the first jar is 880 m/s, while the average speed of the particles in the second jar is 880 m/s.\n\nSince both jars have the same number of particles and the same average speed, the average kinetic energy of the particles in each jar is the same.
